## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
Our assignment was to simulate a blackjack game, with a dealer, a player and hands for each of them. We also needed to model the cards and deck, with the cards being able to be removed and dealt from the deck.

### Technologies/Topics Applied
In this assignment I used enums, linked lists, abstract classes and methods, and made extensive use of object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.

### Lessons Learned
I've noticed with any game, there is a lot of loop management. Learning how to effectively enter and exit loops in order to achieve the desired order of gameplay events is always a key aspect of designing projects like this one. I found making comments stating exactly what I expected from the loop I was working on helped immensely. One issue I did struggle with a bit was passing the private fields of my core classes all the way into my app class. It felt "off" passing data through 2 or 3 consecutive getters, but I eventually got everything functioning the way I wanted.
